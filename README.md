The goal is to generate a shareable customer data set that contains only those elements that are permitted under the disclosure requirements of the HIPAA Privacy Rule. Requirements for the Healthier Choices Program (HCB):

1. Must be verifiably compliant with legal requirements in HIPAA Privacy Rule concerning notice, disclosure and, if applicable, de-identification.
2. Must be web based, including an interface for customers to enroll into the program, and an interface for corporate compliance officers.
3. Must be auditable, which provides our corporate compliance officers the ability to visually inspect enrollment with evidence of compliance with relevant regulations.
4. Must maximize data utility while minimizing regulatory burden and ensuring compliance with the HIPAA Privacy Rule.
5. Must integrate with the assumptions of the existing Giant Eagle Advantage Rewards workflow.
